Then you need to make sure you are not calling join() in the swing thread.
You can do this by creating one thread that is in charge of your download thread.
This is essentially just a background worker that you can forget about.
It is the worker thread that knows when the download finishes and what
to do at that point. You just need to make sure edits to the swing objects
are done in the swing thread.
